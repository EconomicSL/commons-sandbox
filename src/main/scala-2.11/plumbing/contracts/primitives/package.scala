/** Classes for constructing composable contracts.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * Instead of defining a fixed catalogue of financial contracts, we want to
  * define a fixed set of "building blocks" that can be used to modelers to
  * construct commonly encountered financial contracts (i.e., stocks, bonds,
  * deposits, secured and unsecured loans, etc), but that could also be used
  * actors within a model to innovate new, unforeseen financial contracts.
  *
  * ===Composable contracts===
  * Implement the approach from [[https://lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf Peyton-Jones et al (2000)]].
