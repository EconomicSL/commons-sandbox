  * ===Composable contracts===
  *
  * ==A language for Promises==
  * Having defined the concepts of a Good and a Promise as well as sets of
  * actions over Goods and Promises that can be performed by an Actor or groups
  * of Actors to complete the API we need to define a language (grammar?) for
  * building Sentences that describe valid Promises.
  *
  * ===Examples===
  * Need to build a catalogue of examples demonstrating how to build common
  * contracts using our language.
