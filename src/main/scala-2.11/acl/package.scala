/** Provides classes defining a high-level economic actor communication language (ACL).
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * The `acl` package defines a high-level actor communication language (ACL) as well as the
  * [[acl.CommunicatingActor `CommunicatingActor`]] behavioral trait that an actor must implement in order to
  * communicate using the ACL protocol.
  *
  * === Actor Communication Language ===
  * Our high-level actor communication language is influenced by, but not slave to, the [[http://www.fipa.org/
  * Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)]] compliant
  * [[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.pdf Agent Communication Language (ACL)]].
