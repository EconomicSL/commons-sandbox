/** Provides classes defining an economic actor as well as a high-level economic
  * actor communication language (ACL).
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * "To analyze how financial commitments affect the economy it is necessary to
  * look at economic units in terms of their cash flows. The cash-flow approach
  * looks at all units -- be they households, corporations, state and municipal
  * governments, or even national governments -- as if they were banks."
  *
  * The above quotation is taken from Hyman Minsky's magnum opus ''Stabilizing
  * an Unstable Economy''.  Following Minsky, and more recently Perry Mehrling,
  * we view every economic actor as an entity that is both receiving certain
  * cash flow events (i.e., receipts of various kinds) as well as generating
  * cash flow events (i.e., expenditures of various kinds) over time.
  *
  * The accumulation of cash flow events for a particular economic actor is
  * captured by its balance sheet. Most basic constraint that economic actors face in our framework is, to
  * again borrow from Minsky, the survival constraint: the inflow of cash flow
  * events must be at least as big as the outflow of generated cash flow
  * events.  By taking the "banking perspective" our primary concern is the
  * liquidity of economic actors; solvency of economic actors is a secondary
  * concern.
  *
  * Anytime an economic actor needs to make a payment it has only three
  * options:
  *
  *  1. Spend down hoards of money.
  *
  *  2. Liquidate accumulations of financial assets.
  *
  *  3. Increase accumulations of financial liabilities.
  *
  * Crucially both 2 and 3 depend on finding some other economic actor to take
  * the other side of the transaction. This may be easier said than done.  Only
  * option 1 is completely dependable.  Thus the import of money.
  *
  *
  * ===`PromiseMaker`===
  * The `acl` package defines the [[PromiseMakingActor]] trait as well as the
  * high-level [[PromiseMakingActor]] communication language.
  *
  * Our high-level [[PromiseMakingActor]] acl language is influenced by, but not slave
  * to, the [[http://www.fipa.org/ Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)]]
  * compliant [[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.pdf Agent Communication Language (ACL)]].
  *
  * A [[PromiseMakingActor]] communicates with other [[PromiseMakingActor]] actors by making
  * [[acl.Promise promises]] which are then either [[acl.PromiseAccepted accepted]]
  * or [[acl.PromiseRejected rejected]] by the receiving [[PromiseMakingActor]] actors.
