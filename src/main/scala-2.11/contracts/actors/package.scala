/** Classes for representing contracts as Akka Actors.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * A `ContractActor` serves as a channel of communication between multiple
  * `BalanceSheetActors`.
  *
  * ===API Requirements===
  * Any `Actor` that implements the `ContractActorLike` trait should...
  *
  *  - have a collection of `commitments` representing the terms of the
  *  underlying `Contract`.
  *
  *  - have an `issuer` for whom the `Contract` represents a liability.
  *
  *  - have a collection of `owners` for whom the underlying `Contract`
  *  represents an asset.
  *
  *  - be able to modify its `issuer` (necessary in order to model the
  *  buying/selling of liabilities).
  *
  *  - be able to add (remove) members from its collection of `owners`.
  *
  *  - be able to communicate with a `BalanceSheetActor` in order to add
  *  (remove) itself from the collection of assets or liabilities of the
  *  `BalanceSheetActor`.
