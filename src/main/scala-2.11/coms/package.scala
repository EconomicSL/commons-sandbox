/** Provides classes for facilitating communication between economic actors.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * An `Actor` in our API that is `EconomicActorLike` communicates with other
  * `EconomicActorLike` actors by proposing contracts which are then either
  * accepted or rejected by the receiving actors. The `coms` package defines
  * the `EconomicActorLike` trait as well as the high-level `EconomicActorLike`
  * communication language. Our high-level `EconomicActorLike` communication
  * language is influenced by, but not slave to, the [[http://www.fipa.org/
  * Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)]] compliant
  * [[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.pdf
  * Agent Communication Language (ACL)]].
