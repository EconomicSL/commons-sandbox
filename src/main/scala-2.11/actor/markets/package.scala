/** Provides classes for modeling markets.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * The Markets API explicitly defines various disequilbrium dynamic processes
  * by which market prices and quantities are determined.
  *
  * ===Requirements===
  * The Markets API needs to be sufficiently flexible in order to handle markets
  * for relatively homogeneous goods such as firm non-labor inputs, firm outputs,
  * final consumption goods, standard financial products etc., as well as markets
  * for relative heterogeneous goods such as labor, housing, non-standard
  * financial products, etc.
  *
  * Here is my (likely incomplete) list of requirements for the Markets API
  *
  *  - Receive buy and sell orders from other actors.
  *
  *  - Accept (reject) only valid (invalid) buy and sell orders.
  *
  *  - Handle queuing of accepted buy and sell orders as necessary.
  *
  *  - Order execution including price formation and, if necessary, quantity
  *  determination.
  *
  *  - Processing and settlement of executed orders once those orders have been
  *  filled.
  *
  *  - Record keeping of orders received, orders executed, transactions
  *  processed, etc.
  *
  *  Implementation issue: too many requirements for a single market actor to satisfy.
  *  Solution: model the market actor as a ''collection'' of actors. Specifically,
  *  suppose that each `MarketLike` actor is composed of two additional actors:
  *  a `ClearingMechanismLike` actor that models the clearing process of buy and
  *  sell orders, and then a `SettlementMechanismLike` mechanism that processes
  *  the resulting filled orders.

\subsection{\texttt{MarketLike} actor}
The \texttt{MarketLike} actor should directly receive buy and sell orders for a particular \texttt{Tradable}, filter out any invalid orders, and then forward along all valid orders to a \texttt{ClearingMechanismLike} actor for further processing.

\section{Use cases for \texttt{MarketLike} actors}

\subsection{Specific use cases for \texttt{MarketLike} actors}
In this section I sketch out some specific use cases for the Markets API.

\subsubsection{Retail goods market}
\texttt{RetailMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{PostedOfferLike} matching engine,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
Retail goods markets are markets for final consumption goods (typically purchased by households).

\subsubsection{Wholesale goods market}
\texttt{WholesaleMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{BilateralNegotiationLike} matching engine,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
Wholesale goods markets are markets for intermediate goods (typically purchased by firms and then used in the production of retail goods).

\subsubsection{Labor market}
\texttt{LaborMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with either \texttt{BilateralNegotiationLike} or \texttt{PostedOffer} matching engines,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
Labor markets are tricky.  If we use \texttt{BilateralNegotiationLike} clearing mechanism then we can link into the massive search and match literature.

\subsubsection{Housing market}
\texttt{HousingMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{PostedOfferLike} matching engine,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
Note similarity of \texttt{HousingMarketLike} to \texttt{RetailMarketLike}

\subsubsection{Securities market}
\texttt{SecuritiesMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{ContinuousDoubleAuctionLike} matching engine and \texttt{OrderBookLike} order queuing strategy,
    \item \texttt{CentralCounterpartySettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
Securities markets would include markets for stocks, bonds, and currencies. Could even create a \texttt{SecuritiesExchange} actor which would route orders for various securities to the appropriate \texttt{SecuritiesMarketLike} actor.

\subsubsection{Unsecured interbank lending market}
\texttt{InterbankMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{BilateralNegotiationLike} matching engine,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
See Perry Mehrling for more details on unsecured interbank lending markets.

\subsubsection{Secured interbank lending (repo) market}
\texttt{RepoMarketLike} behavior would extend \texttt{MarketLike} behavior with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearing mechanism with \texttt{BilateralNegotiationLike} matching engine,
    \item \texttt{BilateralSettlement} settlement mechanism.
\end{itemize}
See Perry Mehrling for more details on secured interbank lending (repo) markets.
