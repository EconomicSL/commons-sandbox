/** Classes for modeling [[edsl.CounterpartyActor `CounterPartyActor`]] balance sheets.
  *
  * We follow in the tradition of Hyman Minsky and Perry Mehrling and view every actor in our framework as a kind of
  * "bank," in the sense that the primary objective of every such actor is to monitor the balance between its inflow
  * and outflow of payments. The balance between an actor's inflow and outflow of payments is captured by the actor's
  * balance sheet.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * A [[edsl.balancesheets.BalanceSheetLike `BalanceSheetLike`]] object is a statement of the assets, liabilities,
  * and equity of some [[edsl.CounterpartyActor `CounterPartyActor`]] at a particular point in time, detailing the
  * balance of payments inflows (i.e., income) and payment outflows (i.e., expenditure).
