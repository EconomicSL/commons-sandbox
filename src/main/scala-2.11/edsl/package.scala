/** Provides classes defining an embedded domain specific language (EDSL) that
  * can be used to create composable commercial contracts.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * Instead of defining a fixed catalogue of contracts our approach is to follow...
  *
  *   - [[https://lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf Peyton-Jones et al (2000)]]
  *   - [[http://www.itu.dk/~elsborg/sttt06.pdf Andersen et al (2006)]]
  *
  * ...and instead define a small set of atomic contracts, called
  * [[edsl.commitments commitments]], that can be used as "building blocks"
  * to construct ever more complex contracts.
  *
  * ===Composable Commercial Contracts===
  * Following [[http://www.itu.dk/~elsborg/sttt06.pdf Andersen et al (2006)]]
  * we focus on the following basic ''contract patterns'' for composing
  * commercial edsl from sub-edsl:
  *
  *  - A ''commitment'' stipulates the transfer of a resource or a set of
  *  resources between two parties; a commitment represents an ''atomic''
  *  `Contract`.
  *
  *  - A `Contract` may require ''sequential'' execution of its sub-contracts.
  *
  *  - A `Contract` may require ''concurrent'' execution of its sub-contracs,
  *  i.e., execution of all sub-edsl, where individual commitments are
  *  inter-leavened in any order.
  *
  *  - A `Contract` may require execution of one of a number of ''alternative''
  *  sub-edsl.
  *
  *  - A `Contract` may require ''repeated'' execution of a sub-contract.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  * A contract is composed of the following...
  *
  *  - An issuer: the issuer is the economic actor for which the contract
  *  represents a liability.
  *
  *  - A mutable collection of owners: the owners are economic edsl for
  *  which the contract represents an asset.
  *
  * ===Requirements===
  * Current list of requirements for edsl is as follows...
  *
  *  1. Each contract has a collection of commitments.
  *
  *  2. Each contract must have both a face value (objective) and a present value (subjective).
  *
  *  3. Need a little language for modifying commitments.  Tentatively based
  *  around the Sources and Uses terminology from lecture 4 of Perry Mehrling's
  *  course on ''Money and Banking.''
  *
  * ===Composable edsl===
  *
  * ==A language for Promises==
  * Having defined the concepts of a Good and a Promise as well as sets of
  * actions over Goods and Promises that can be performed by an Actor or groups
  * of Actors to complete the API we need to define a language (grammar?) for
  * building Sentences that describe valid Promises.
  *
  * ==Observables==
  * Every contract must have an Observable[T] which represents the stream of
  * data (or events?) that parties to the contract have used to condition
  * the specifics of the contract.
  *
  * Parties to the contract must subscribe as Observer[T] to the Observable.
  *
  * Examples
  * Need to build a catalogue of examples demonstrating how to build common
  * edsl using our language.
