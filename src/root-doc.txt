==Overview==
Our API consists of several different layers each of which is represented by
its own package.

===`coms` package===
An `Actor` in our API that is `EconomicActorLike` communicates with other
`EconomicActorLike` actors by proposing contracts which are either accepted or
rejected. The `coms` package defines the `EconomicActorLike` trait as well as
the high-level `EconomicActor` communication language.

Our high-level `EconomicActor` communication language is influences by, but
not slave to, the [[http://www.fipa.org/ Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)]]
compliant [[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.pdf Agent Communication Language (ACL)]].

===`contracts` package===
The `contract` package defines the low-level domain specific language (DSL)
that we use for constructing commercial contracts. Instead of defining a fixed
catalogue of contracts our approach is to follow...

 - [[https://lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf Peyton-Jones et al (2000)]]
 - [[http://www.itu.dk/~elsborg/sttt06.pdf Andersen et al (2006)]]

...and instead define a small set of atomic contracts, called
[[contracts.commitments `commitments`]], that can be used as "building blocks"
to construct ever more complex contracts.
