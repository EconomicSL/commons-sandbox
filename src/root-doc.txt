==Overview==
Our API consists of several different layers each of which is represented by
its own package.

===`acl` package===
A [[acl.PromiseMaker]] communicates with other [[acl.PromiseMaker]] actors by making
promises which are then either accepted or rejected by the receiving
[[acl.PromiseMaker]] actor. The [[acl]] package defines the [[acl.PromiseMaker]] trait
as well as the high-level [[acl.PromiseMaker]] communication language.

Our high-level [[acl.PromiseMaker]] acl language is influenced by, but
not slave to, the [[http://www.fipa.org/ Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)]]
compliant [[http://www.fipa.org/specs/fipa00037/SC00037J.pdf Agent Communication Language (ACL)]].

===`edsl` package===
The [[edsl]] package defines the low-level embedded domain specific language (DSL)
that we use for constructing composable commercial contracts. Instead of defining a fixed
catalogue of contracts our approach is to follow...

 - [[https://lexifi.com/files/resources/MLFiPaper.pdf Peyton-Jones et al (2000)]]
 - [[http://www.itu.dk/~elsborg/sttt06.pdf Andersen et al (2006)]]

...and instead define a small set of atomic contracts, called
[[edsl.commitments `commitments`]], that can be used as "building blocks"
to construct ever more complex contracts.

===`actor` package===
