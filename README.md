A workspace for developing reusable components for large-scale agent based models (ABMs) of social systems.

## Getting started
The following instructions will help walk you through the process of downloading and installing the necessary software.

### Install Java 8
Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 

### Install Activator

Once you have installed JDK 8, then you can download and install [Typesafe Activator](https://www.typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt). Activator includes the sbt build tool, a quick-start GUI, and a catalog of template applications.  Mac users can install the Activator via Homebrew (assuming of course that you have installed [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)) using the following command in a terminal to install Activator.

    $ brew install activator

## Code coverage
Out project uses the [sbt-scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) plugin to generate test coverage statistics. To run all tests with coverage enabled simply run the following command in a terminal from the project root directory.

    $ sbt clean coverage test

After the tests have finished you can then run

    $ sbt coverageReport

to generate the reports. The generated code coverage reports can be found inside the following folder.

    commons-sandbox/target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report

## API documentation

The API documentation for the project is very much a work in progress. To generate the most current version of the documentation simply run the following command from the project root directory.

    $ sbt doc
    
To view the documentation, simply open the following file in your favorite browser.
