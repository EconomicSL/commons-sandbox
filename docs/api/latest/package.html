      <p class="shortcomment cmt">Provides classes for modeling a decentralized payments system.</p><div class="fullcomment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Provides classes for modeling a decentralized payments system.</p><h4>Overview</h4><p>&quot;The logical origins of the money market can be traced, perhaps
surprisingly, to the operations of a decentralized payments system.&quot;</p><p>The above quotation from Chapter 5 of Perry Mehrling's <i>The New Lombard
Street</i> provides an underlying motivation for our plumbing API. Taking as
given that money markets exist because of imperfections in a decentralized
payment system, answering any of the important (and policy-relevant!)
research questions surrounding the functioning of money markets requires an
explicit model of the underlying payment system.</p><p>Of course, for some research questions, imperfections in the underlying
payments system may not play an important role.  In such cases it makes
sense to apply Occam's razor and consider some sort of idealized payments
system.</p><h5>Balance Sheets</h5><p>Every economic actor has its own balance sheet. We think of the economy as
a set of interlocking balance sheets in which the financial liabilities of
one economic actor are the financial assets of some other economic actor.
An economic actor's financial liabilities are composed of commitments to
pay (usually commitments to make a recurring series of payments at certain
points in the future).</p><p>Balance sheets communicate with one another via contracts.</p><h5>Contracts</h5><p>Contracts communicate with balance sheets.</p><h4>General API requirements</h4><p>Current list of generic requirements for the <code>plumbing</code> API</p><ul><li>A payment system should be able to process both real and financial
transactions between economic actors.</li><li>A payment system should be able to settle a transactions between two
 economic actors directly (i.e., without inter-mediation).</li><li>A payment system should be able to settle a transactions between two
 economic actors indirectly (i.e., via inter-mediation by some other
 economic actor).</li><li>The desired payment system for a particular model should be completely
configurable from some kind of <code>application.conf</code> file.</li></ul><h4>Use cases</h4><p>I have taken the use cases more or less verbatim from <i>Lecture 5: The
Central Bank as a Clearing House</i> of Perry Mehrling's course on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/money" target="_blank">Money and Banking</a>.</p><h5>One big bank</h5><p>An important use case for us to consider is an idealized payments system
in which all economic agents have a deposit account and a line of credit at
a single, large bank. In this world, all payments involve nothing more than
book keeping operations for the bank.  This use case would serve as a
natural benchmark and could be used for models where we wish to abstract
from imperfections in the payment system (and money markets).</p><p>There are at least two important sub use cases for our idealized payment
system:</p><ul><li>No overdrafts: Deposit account holders are required to hold non-negative
 account balances. Obvious measure of the money supply in this case is
 currency outstanding plus deposit balances. Note that this case represents
 a pure money payment system (i.e., there is no credit).</li><li>Overdrafts: Deposit account holders can hold negative account balances
 (up to some limit). A negative deposit account balance is effectively an
 unsecured loan. Note that, with overdrafts, it is no longer obvious how
 to measure the money supply! Sensible measure would be the sum of currency
 outstanding, bank deposits, and overdrafts. Use of overdrafts as a method
 of payment means that this payment system is at least party credit based.
 The money supply can be expected to expand and contract over the business
 cycle (depending on the patterns of payments).</li></ul><h6>Multiple banks</h6><p>Simplest use case for multiple banks is a payment system where all
interbank payments are made using reserves (either Gold or some other
reserve currency).</p><p>Another use case would be bilateral intra-day netting.  Under bilateral
intra-day netting each bank nets payments to every other bank and pays only
the net in reserves.</p><p>Third use case would be correspondent banking. With correspondent banking,
banks have deposit accounts at other banks which they use to make interbank
payments. Correspondent banking (with overdrafts) is basically another step
away from a money payment system towards a credit based payment system.
With correspondent banking the money supply is not constrained by the
quantity of reserves, but only by the various bilateral credit limits.</p><h6>Clearing houses</h6><p>In any system of bilateral interbank payments, any particular bank may at
the same time be making payments to one bank while receiving payments from
some other bank. A bank would like to be able to net payments across all of
its correspondents.</p><p>Simple way to accomplish this would be for all banks to maintain correspondent
deposits at one bank and then use that bank's deposits to settle transactions.
In order to maintain elasticity of the money supply, we need to allow for
overdrafts.  However problems can arise if multiple banks require overdrafts at
the same time.</p><p>Better system would be to have a group of banks form a clearing house. All member
banks treat all payments due to (from) other member banks as due to (from) the
clearing house. In this way member banks can accomplish multilateral netting
between one another during the day: each bank makes only a single net payment
at close of business. Settlement is done using clearing house certificates which
amount to a private form of reserves.  In the event that a member bank(s) is
unable to settle its account at the end of the day, then the member bank must
borrow from the clearing house.  The clearing house meets this demand for
reserves by creates additional reserves in the form of clearing house loan
certificates out of thin air. Clearing house loan certificates are typically
over collateralized (and pay interest).</p><p>Private clearing houses play important roles in several modern financial systems
most notable in the U.S. (<a href="https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payments/chips" target="_blank">CHIPS</a>)
and in the UK (<a href="http://www.chapsco.co.uk/" target="_blank">CHAPS</a>).</p><h6>Central banking</h6><p>One way to view central banking is as a natural extension of clearing house
arrangements. A notable difference is that, with central banking, there is only
central bank reserves: no longer any difference between clearing house
certificates and clearing house loan certificates.</p></div></div>
